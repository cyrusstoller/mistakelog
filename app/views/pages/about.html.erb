      <h1>ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About Mistake Log</h1>

      <p>
        We all make mistakes and experience failures from time to time.
        Often we don't think about them.
        It's a missed opportunity to not take time to think through these situations.
        Athletes spend countless hours reviewing film to see how they can do better in the future.
        While I don‚Äôt have game film, I‚Äôve started to write down mistakes that I want to
        reflect on later.
      </p>

      <p>
        I built the first version of Mistake Log to help me look for recurring themes
        and trends in my mistakes and failures.
        Sometimes I've found that things that I thought were a big deal in the moment turn out to
        be relatively insignificant. And other times, it's the opposite.
        From this habit, I've learned that I'm predictably irrational in similar situations.
      </p>

      <h3>üõ† How it works</h3>

      <p>
        Step 1) describe a mistake (or failure) with an initial rating that you'd like to reflect on later.
        There's also an optional quantitative measure that I've found useful.
      </p>

      <p>
        Step 2) Mistake Log will send you an email reminding you to reflect on each mistake.
      </p>

      <p>
        That's it. It's meant be simple and easy to use.
        If you use hashtags, you can click on them to see similar mistakes and reflections clustered together.

      <% unless current_user %>
        <div class="buttons">
          <%= link_to "Sign up now", new_user_registration_path, class: "button is-link" %>
        </div>
      <% end %>

      <h3>üôà Privacy</h3>

      <p>
        Sharing mistakes is highly personal; most of us are only comfortable being vulnerable with our inner cicle.
        As such, your Mistake Log is private and only accessible to you.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm offering this hosted-service as a convenience. I'm not going to sell or disclose any of the data
        that is entered into the site unless given express written consent.
        But, there's no need to take my word for it.

      <h3>‚ö°Ô∏è Improvements</h3>

      <p>
        I enthusiastically welcome pull requests and potential enhancements.
        Hopefully, we can make this tool as useful as possible.
